- We see if tm to tm+2hrs (within insulin data) has any tp, do we need to see it this way:
	- get tm
	- go to CGMData and get ealliest DT greater than tm
	- find tm+2hrs in CGMData
	- come back to Ins data and check the range found in CGMData to get valid meal data
	This just sounds too much and dont think it is expected.

- Considering getting start time values in insulin. Then, get CGMData time value and add +2hrs30min to that

- The chosen mask is <= 30min and > 2hrs
	- exclude the time exactly at tm+2hrs (gives more samples to train)

- Have only those meal data/no meal data where the length is 30 (with or without NaN) and the size without NaN is >= 80%*30

- No Meal data is where it doesnt collapse with 2HOUR meal data stretches (NOT WITH 30min before)

FOR FEATURE EXTRACTORS:

- currently taking indices for time (could take it *5 to get the minutes value)

- fft or rfft (sticking to rfft for now)
